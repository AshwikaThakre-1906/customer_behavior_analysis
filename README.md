# Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow — from loading raw data in Python to generating insights through SQL and visualizing them in an interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal is to convert raw data into meaningful information to support better business decision-making. Key tasks include data loading, EDA and cleaning in Python, SQL analysis using PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQL Server, dashboard creation in Power BI, and reporting & presentation using Gamma.

## Dataset
A structured CSV/Excel dataset containing customer details, transaction data, product/category information, and date, time, discount and revenue fields. The dataset was processed in Python using the Pandas library.

## Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Power BI, Gamma, SQLAlchemy, Microsoft Excel, Jupyter Notebook / VS Code.

## Steps Performed
1. Data Loading: Imported data and checked structure and data types.
2. EDA: Identified missing values, outliers and trends.
3. Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled nulls and fixed data types.
4. SQL Analysis: Executed queries for average sales, top customers and category revenue.
5. Dashboard: Built interactive Power BI dashboard with KPIs, trends and comparison charts.
6. Report & PPT: Created analytical report and Gamma presentation.

## Dashboard Highlights
Total sales and revenue trends, top customers and products, category performance, time-based analysis and discount vs profit. Includes interactive filters and slicers.

## Results
Identified high-value customers, best and worst performing categories, seasonal trends, and generated data-driven business recommendations.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates strong skills in Python, SQL (multiple databases), Power BI, data analysis, cleaning and professional reporting.
